# Home-Price-Prediction
This is a simple ML model which predicts House prices on various aspects.
Here I worked with various ML algorithms like Decision Tree, Regression and performed various model validation tests to test the accuracy of the model using mean absolute error, mean squared error, r2 score, etc. 
In this, I worked with various libraries like numpy, pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, and Sk learn. This has given me a basic understanding of how these tools used in Data analysis and Data Science
This practice really helps to understand how to work with data and analysis.
This gives the motivation to work on furthermore projects.
I know this is a very basic model it's okay for me to start.
